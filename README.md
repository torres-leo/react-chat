# React Chat

The Simple Chat App is a basic real-time chat application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with the
Socket.io library for the backend. It allows multiple users to send and receive messages in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time without needing to refresh the page.
- Simple UI: The app has a straightforward and easy-to-use interface for chatting.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js with Express and Socket.io

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

In the root of this project, you will be able to run the backend. First, we need to install all dependecies:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn

```bash
yarn
```

Then we can start the server:

```bash
npm run dev || yarn dev
```

### Frontend

Acces to the frontend folder and apply the same commands we did to start the backend.

## Accessing the App

In the terminal that you start the frontend, will see an url that you can be redirected press (CTRL + left click), you
can open as many as you want, and will see all the messages that you sent on every screen.
